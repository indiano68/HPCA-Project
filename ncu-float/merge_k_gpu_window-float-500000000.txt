    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.      
          Start by analyzing workloads in the Compute Workload Analysis section.

    OPT   ALU is the highest-utilized pipeline (74.5%) based on active cycles, taking into account the rates of its     
          different instructions. It executes integer and logic operations. The pipeline is well-utilized, but might    
          become a bottleneck if more work is added. Based on the number of executed instructions, the highest          
          utilized pipeline (74.5%) is ALU. It executes integer and logic operations. Comparing the two, the overall    
          pipeline utilization appears to be caused by frequent, low-latency instructions. See the Kernel Profiling     
          Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-decoder) or hover over the    
          pipeline name to understand the workloads handled by each pipeline. The Instruction Statistics section shows

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 20.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 18.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.
