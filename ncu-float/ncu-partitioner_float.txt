          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 5.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          3.94 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.19 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp  
          State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 17.2 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on  
          a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited     
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 73.8% of the total average of 23.3 cycles

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to  
          0.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.          
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 1      
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          The difference between calculated theoretical (50.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (23.7%) can be the

          The 8.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the
